# coordinate-detection

This repository is aimed at the heavy tasks to read a bunch of scanned maps with coordinates maybe written in the corners of the map. We use a visual method to help us reach our goal.

And now, we have a relatively `qt` form which can be loaded almost on all the platform!

Before further introduction, you can use `python __main__.py` to run the whole program and have a test on your own map!
